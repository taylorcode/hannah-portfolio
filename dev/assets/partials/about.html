	<p>My name is Hannah Zimmerman and I am finishing up my fifth and final year of landscape architecture at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, CA. I was born and raised in Santa Barbara, which drew me to explore the nature and innovative architecture around me. The cover of the portfolio is a photograph I took of my favorite spot called More Mesa. This is the place that initially inspired me to pursue the profession.</p>
	<p>I entered Cal Poly as a City and Regional Planning student because I was captivated with the idea of transforming areas for people to use and enjoy. From here I was drawn to smaller scale details because I am a perfectionist. I find joy in figuring out every detail of a project. Landscape architecture sounded like the perfect niche because it was able to combine nature, something I escape to with any opportunity and art, a lifetime passion of mine. There is no doubt in my mind that this is the career path for me because after five years I am still passionate about the profession. I catch myself watching tutorials and researching current projects endlessly.</p>
	<p>I am fascinated by the idea of pushing the design envelope to make environments more sustainable, while simultaneously surpassing the societal needs. Ultimately I aim to be part of an interdisciplinary team to create cohesive environments for all types of users, while at the same time encouraging people to enjoy nature as much as I do.</p>
